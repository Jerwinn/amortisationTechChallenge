If I had more time in building this technical challenge I would have done the following things:

- LOGIC
  - I would have changed my implementation to ensure that there are no rounding errors in the buildSchedule function

- API
  - Completed the rest of the CRUD, so you could update an amortisation and delete amortisation based on Id.
  - Could also implement delete all amortisation.


- TEST
  - Written tests for the controller methods (POST & GET) using SpringBootTest 
  - I would have done end-to-end testing to cover the entire software from start to finish.
  - Possibly write a behavioural-driven development testing(BDD) if I was familiar with it.


- If I work on this implementation again: 
  - I would write both end-to-end tests and integration tests for my service.
  - By doing that I'm sure that I will not introduce any bugs or break existing functionality.


- Little bonus if more time :)
  - implement react & typescript frontend where users can input their data
  - Use axios for middleware to communicate with the backend
  - Essentially the goal would be a full-stack application.
